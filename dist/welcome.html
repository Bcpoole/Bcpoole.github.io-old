        I started co-oping at Johnson Outdoors Inc., Marine Electronics (Humminbird) in Fall 2013 after my freshman year and finished in Spring of 2015.
        There I primarily worked on WPF applications using the Caliburn.Micro MVVM framework and using SQL Server.
        During Summer 2015, I interned at 42six Solutions, LLC, where I setup Hadoop clusters and worked on a Hackathon team for government contracts.

        primarily working with .NET web apps.

        I currently serve as the Social Committee Chair for UA's ACM chapter, where I have successfully evolved our club from a meetings-only body.
        We also now have several cross-organization social events throughout the year.
