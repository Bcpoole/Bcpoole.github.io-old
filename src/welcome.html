    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
      <p>I am an undergraduate at the University of Alabama graduating in December 2016. This summer I interned at 84.51​°​
        in Cincinnati, OH who does consumer data analytics for Kroger as an App Developer Intern. My team works on creating
        Angular 2 web apps with Java backend with Java and C# services that make using our science services easier for our
        analysts.
      </p>
      <p>Last the summer I worked for 42six Solutions, LLC in Columbia, MD, now owned by CSC. One of the projects I worked on
        was a week­long hackathon using the openFDA API for a FDA contract. The other project I worked on was setting up
        and implementing a Hadoop cluster and web app for the FAA.
      </p>
      <p>Last spring I finished my co­op working as a Process/Test Engineer Co­op at Johnson Outdoors Marine Electronics, a
        division of Johnson Outdoors Inc. (NASDAQ: JOUT). I mainly dealt with creating/updating C# applications that manage
        different types of data through Microsoft SQL Server. These applications were usually WPF using MVVM architectural
        pattern through the Caliburn.Micro framework.
      </p>
      <p>During my free time I’ve been developing chiefly using the Aurelia JavaScript framework for ES2015.
      </p>
      <p>My primary interests are fullstack software engineering and data science since I am interested in the creation and
        discovery part of programming. The fact I can relatively create something from nothing is really exciting. I am always
        excited to explore opportunities with new technologies.
