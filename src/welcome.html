    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        I am senior graduating in in December 2016 from the University of Alabama with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
        I currently serve as the Social Committee Chair for UA's ACM chapter, where I have successfully evolved our club from a meetings-only body.
        We also now have several cross-organization social events throughout the year.

        I started co-oping at <a href="http://www.humminbird.com/freshwater/home/" target="_blank">Johnson Outdoors Inc., Marine Electronics (Humminbird)</a> in Fall 2013 after my freshman year and finished in Spring of 2015.
        There I mainly used C# writing in-house WPF applications using the Caliburn.Micro MVVM framework and backed with SQL Server.

        During Summer 2015, I interned at <a href="http://42six.com/" target="_blank">42six Solutions, LLC</a>, where I primarily worked with AngularJS and Hadoop clusters created with Hortonworks HDP.
        Additionally I participated in the openFDA Hackathon where we developed the Twitter results based web app <a href="https://github.com/42sixsolutions/claire" target="_blank">Claire</a>.

        Starting in September 2015, I've been working for the <a href="http://www.caps.ua.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Advanced Public Safety (CAPS)</a> as a Student Developer,
        primarily working with .NET web apps.
